# Jump-Higher-Game-OpenGL-ES-Java-PHP
<div>
  This project was implemented during Android course at <a href="https://english.afeka.ac.il/">Afeka Academic College of Engineering.</a>
  <br>
  <br><br>
  The idea of the project is to build an network game kind of "MMORPG" where people can compete with each other in order to be the top best player.
  <br><br>
  The interesting part except the graphics is that the whole game is controlled without touching the screen,but using the different device sensors.
  <br><br>
  There is a sphere placed on a circular surface which is  moving according to the device orientation,
  the challenge is to not drop the ball from the surface but bounce it to the next surface.
  <br><br>
  The jumping from surface to surface is done by moving the device up/down by striking the device like in wooden rackets game,
  furthermore the surfaces are placed in different heights which makes the game more challenging,the best player is the one who got to the highest surface in a minimum time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project implements:
  <br><br>
  1. <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/opengl">OpenGL ES API</a>
  <br>
  2. PHP and MySQL DB on the server side with HTTP requests on the android client side
  <br>
  3. Android device <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types">sensors</a> (Accelerometer,Gyroscope,Magnetometer)
  <br>
  4. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/">FaceBook login API</a>
